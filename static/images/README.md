## How to Create Professional Screenshots

### Recommended Approach: Browser Mockups

   - Take full-page or hero section screenshots
   - Use browser dev tools to set viewport to 1920x1080
   - Capture in PNG format

2. **Create Browser Mockups** (Recommended Tools)
   - **[Screely](https://screely.com)** - Free, instant browser mockups
     - Upload your screenshot
     - Choose browser style (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
     - Download PNG with transparent background

   - **[Shot.so](https://shot.so)** - Customizable mockups
     - Upload screenshot
     - Customize colors, padding, shadows
     - Export as PNG

   - **[ScreenshotRocks](https://screenshots.rocks)** - Multiple device frames
     - Upload screenshot
     - Choose device/browser frame
     - Download high-res PNG

### Alternative: Animated GIFs (Optional)

For more interactive previews, you can also create animated GIFs:
- Use [Screen to GIF](https://www.screentogif.com/) on Windows
- Record short interaction (5-10 seconds)
- Save as optimized GIF
- Name as `{project}-demo.gif`

## Image Specifications

- **Format:** PNG (recommended) or WebP
- **Dimensions:** Minimum 1200px width
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 or 4:3 works best
- **File Size:** Optimize to < 500KB each using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)

## Quick Start for Planno

Since Planno URL is available (https://planno-eta.vercel.app/):

1. Visit https://planno-eta.vercel.app/
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Set device toolbar to Desktop HD (1920x1080)
4. Take screenshot (Windows: Win+Shift+S, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4)
5. Go to https://screely.com
6. Upload the screenshot
7. Download the mockup as `planno-preview.png`
8. Place in this directory

## Fallback Behavior

If images are not available, the gallery will automatically show:
- Colored placeholder with icon
- Animated shimmer effect
- "Image Coming Soon" text

The app is designed to handle missing images gracefully with `onerror` handlers.
